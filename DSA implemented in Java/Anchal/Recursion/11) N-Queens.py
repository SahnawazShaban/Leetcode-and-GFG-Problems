51. N-Queens

Hard

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 9

Time Complexity:
The main function, solveNQueens, initializes an empty board and then calls the recursive helper function to solve to find all solutions.
The solve function is a backtracking algorithm that explores all possible placements of queens on the board.
In the worst case, the backtracking algorithm will explore all possible configurations, leading to a time complexity of O(N!), where N is the number of queens (size of the chessboard).
Each recursive call in the solve function involves checking the safety of placing a queen, and the safety check involves traversing rows and columns, contributing to a constant factor.
Overall, the time complexity is O(N!) with a moderate constant factor.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity mainly consists of the space required for the chessboard and the call stack during recursion.
The chessboard is represented by a 2D list of size N x N, contributing O(N^2) space.
The recursive calls use the call stack, and in the worst case (all queens placed successfully), the maximum depth of the call stack will be N.
Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N^2 + N) â‰ˆ O(N^2).

In summary, the time complexity is exponential (O(N!)) due to the nature of the backtracking algorithm, and the space complexity 
is quadratic (O(N^2)). Keep in mind that these are theoretical worst-case complexities, and the actual performance may vary depending 
on the specific input and the efficiency of the pruning strategy used in backtracking.

Time - O(N!) - In the solution tree, number of valid exploration paths from a node reduces by 2 at each level. In first level, we have N columns options to place the queen i.e N paths from the root node. In the next level, we have max N-2 options available because we can't place the queen in same column and same diagonal as previous queen. In the next level, it will be N-4 because of two columns and two diagonals occupied by previous two queens. This will continue and give us a O(N!)Time. (Let me know if you think otherwise :) )

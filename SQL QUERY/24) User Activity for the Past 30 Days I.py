1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

Easy

Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
 

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


Example 1:
Input: 
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |

| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |

# Solution 
# Write your MySQL query statement below

'''
# SOLUTION - 1
SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(distinct user_id) AS active_users 
FROM Activity 
WHERE activity_date >= '2019-06-28' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date;


# SOUTION - 2
SELECT activity_date day, count(distinct user_id) active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 29
GROUP BY activity_date;

git push origin branch-name

git branch : To list all branches in your repository
git branch <branch_name> : To create a new branch
git branch -d <branch_name> : To delete a branch (be careful with this, as it permanently deletes the branch)

git checkout <branch_name> : This command is used to switch between branches or create a new branch and switch to it. To switch to an existing branch
git checkout -b <new_branch_name> : To create and switch to a new branch in one step


Use the following command to delete a folder and its contents:
git rm -r foldername

To copy and paste a folder from one branch to another branch in Git, you can follow these steps:

1.Checkout the source branch:
Make sure you are on the source branch from which you want to copy the folder.

git checkout source-branch

2.Copy the folder:
You can use the git checkout command with the path of the folder you want to copy. This will copy the contents of the folder to your working directory.

git checkout source-branch -- path/to/folder
Replace source-branch with the name of the source branch and path/to/folder with the relative path to the folder you want to copy.

3.Create or switch to the target branch:
If the target branch already exists, switch to it. If it doesn't exist, create the branch first, and then switch to it.

To create a new branch and switch to it:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b target-branch
Replace target-branch with the name you want to give to the new branch.

4.Add and commit the copied folder:
Stage and commit the copied folder to the target branch.

bash
Copy code
git add path/to/folder
git commit -m "Copy folder from source-branch"


5.Push the changes (if needed):
If you want to make the changes available to a remote repository, push the changes to the remote repository.

bash
Copy code
git push origin target-branch
Now, the folder from the source branch is copied to the target branch. You can switch to the target branch to work with the copied folder as needed.
